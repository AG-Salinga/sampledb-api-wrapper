# SampleDB API Wrapper
## What it does
This package is a simple Python wrapper for the [HTTP API](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/developer_guide/api.html) of [SampleDB](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/), a web-based sample and measurement metadata database developed at PGI and JCNS.

This Python wrapper may also be used e.g. in Matlab and Julia.

## Installation
User installation using pip:
```
pip install --upgrade --user sampledbapi
```

```

```
