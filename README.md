# SampleDB API Wrapper
## What it does
This package is a simple Python wrapper for the [HTTP API](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/developer_guide/api.html) of [SampleDB](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/), a web-based sample and measurement metadata database developed at PGI and JCNS.

This Python wrapper may also be used e.g. in Matlab and Julia.

## Installation
User installation using pip:
```
pip install --upgrade --user sampledbapi
```

System installation using pip:
```
pip install --upgrade sampledbapi
```

## Example usage

### Python
```python
from sampledbapi import *

server_address = ...
api_key = ...

# Authentication
authenticate(server_address, api_key)

# Simple queries
print(actions.get_list())
print(objects.get(123))
print(instruments.get_list())

# Advanced search
print(objects.get_list("material == \"Sb\""))
```

More examples for usage in Python can be found [here](https://ag-salinga.zivgitlabpages.uni-muenster.de/sampledb-api-wrapper/Examples.html).

### Matlab

You need a working installation of Python and `sampledbapi` installed for this to work.
Some type conversions are needed (e.g. to pass integers).

```matlab
% Authentication
py.sampledbapi.authenticate("https://...", "your_api_key")

% Simple queries
print(instruments.get_list())
py.sampledbapi.objects.get(py.int(123))
py.sampledbapi.instruments.get_list())

% Advanced search
l = py.sampledbapi.objects.get_list('material == "Sb"')
obj = l{1}
obj.data
```

In an analogous way, the Python examples shown [here](https://ag-salinga.zivgitlabpages.uni-muenster.de/sampledb-api-wrapper/Examples.html) can be used in Matlab.

## Documentation

The current API documentation can be found [here](https://ag-salinga.zivgitlabpages.uni-muenster.de/sampledb-api-wrapper).
Further details on the input and output of each function (usually JSON) can be found in the documentation of the [HTTP API](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/developer_guide/api.html).
