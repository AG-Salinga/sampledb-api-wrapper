# SampleDB API Wrapper
## What it does
This package is a simple Python wrapper for the [HTTP API](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/developer_guide/api.html) of [SampleDB](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/), a web-based sample and measurement metadata database developed at PGI and JCNS.

This Python wrapper may also be used e.g. in Matlab and Julia.

## Installation
User installation using pip:
```
pip install --upgrade --user sampledbapi
```

System installation using pip:
```
pip install --upgrade sampledbapi
```

## Example usage
```python
from sampledbapi import *

server_address = ...
api_key = ...

authenticate(server_address, api_key)
print(objects.getList())
print(objects.get(123))
print(instruments.getList())
```

## Documentation

The current API documentation can be found [here](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/ag-salinga/sampledb-api-wrapper/-/jobs/artifacts/v0.3.0/file/doc/_build/index.html?job=deploy_production).
Further details on the input and output of each function (usually JSON) can be found in the documentation of the [HTTP API](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/developer_guide/api.html).
